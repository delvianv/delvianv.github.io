## About me

**I'm a software developer specialising in building beautiful cross-platform desktop apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux using Python and Qt. I also have experience in building web and mobile apps for iOS and Android using Django and JavaScript with React and React Native.**

_My work experience for the past 20 years is a combination of software and hardware roles. Highlights in my career include building apps for a financial service company, programming automation systems, and maintaining communication equipment for the SA Air Force._

**I enjoy learning**

I'm a self-taught programmer with many years of experience. I learned programming from library books in 1998 when I was 12 years old, long before the Internet became the resource it is today. I built my first real app, a point-of-sale system, when I graduated from high school.

**I like solving problems**

One of the things I like about programming is being able to build something out of nothing, but I like the satisfaction of solving difficult problems even more.

**I have a rare combination of skills**

I graduated from a technical high school with qualifications in Electrical and in Logic Systems. I also studied Electronics and Logic Systems at college, so I understand exactly how the software interacts with the hardware.

**I value teamwork and discipline**

Being a soldier taught me the value of teamwork and instilled in me character traits such as discipline, respect, perseverance, attention to detail, and pride in my work.
