## About me

**I specialise in building beautiful cross-platform desktop apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux using Python and Qt. Additionally, I have experience creating web and mobile apps for iOS and Android with Django, JavaScript, React, and React Native.**

_Over the past two decades, my career has blended software and hardware roles. Key achievements include building apps for a financial services company, programming electrical automation systems, and maintaining communication equipment for the South African Air Force._

**I am passionate about learning**

I am a self-taught programmer with many years of experience, beginning my journey at 12 years old in 1998, learning from library books well before the Internet became the resource it is today. My first significant project was a point-of-sale system, which I built after graduating from high school.

**I am a problem-solving enthusiast**

Programming allows me to create something from nothing, but what I enjoy most is the satisfaction of solving complex problems.

**I have a unique skill set**

I bring a rare combination of skills, having graduated from a technical high school with qualifications in Electrical Engineering and Logic Systems. My college studies in Electronic Engineering and Logic Systems further deepen my understanding of the interplay between software and hardware.

**Teamwork and discipline**

My time as a soldier instilled in me the importance of teamwork and core values such as discipline, respect, perseverance, attention to detail, and pride in my work.
